## Model Implementations in ForSyDe-Shallow

[ForSyDe-Shallow](https://forsyde.github.io/forsyde-shallow/) is the
flagship and the oldest modeling language of the ForSyDe methodology
[@sander-2004]. It is a domain specific language (DSL)
shallow-embedded into the functional programming language Haskell and
uses the host's type system, lazy evaluation mechanisms and the
concept of higher-order functions to describe the formal modeling
framework defined by ForSyDe.

As a first exercise we present a rather na√Øve model the AESA
application in ForSyDe-Shallow which matches as much as possible the
specification model presented in [@fig:video-chain-spec]. We gradually
build the mindset and introduce modeling concepts while we parse the
source code of the ForSyDe model.
