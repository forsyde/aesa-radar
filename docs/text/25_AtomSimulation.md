## Model Simulation Against Test Data{#sec:atom-sim}

As a first trial to validate that our AESA high-level model is "sane", i.e. is
modeling the expected behavior, we test it against realistic input data from an array
of antennas detecting some _known_ objects. For this we have provided a set of data
generator and plotter scripts, along with an executable binary created with the
`HighLevelAtom` module presented in @sec:atom-network. Please read the project's
`README` file pointed at the beginning of this chapter, about what software
dependencies and command line arguments are necessary to compile and run the model
application.
