abstract="This paper analyzes the use of models for timed systems, particularly cyber-physical systems, which mix timed behavior of physical subsystems with largely untimed behavior of software. It examines how models are used in engineering and science, showing that two complementary styles for using models lead to differing conclusions about how to approach the problem of modeling timed systems. The paper argues for an increased use of an engineering style of modeling, where models are more like specifications of desired behavior and less like descriptions of some preexisting system. Finally, it argues that in the engineering style of modeling, determinism is an extremely valuable property.",

  abstract =	 "The ForSyDe methodology aims to push system design
                  to a higher level of abstraction by combining the
                  functional programming paradigm with the theory of
                  Models of Computation (MoCs). A key concept of
                  ForSyDe is the use of higher-order functions as
                  process constructors to create processes. This leads
                  to well-defined and well-structured ForSyDe models
                  and gives a solid base for formal analysis. The book
                  chapter introduces the basic concepts of the ForSyDe
                  modeling framework and presents libraries for
                  several MoCs and MoC interfaces for the modeling of
                  heterogeneous systems, including support for the
                  modeling of run-time reconfigurable processes.",
